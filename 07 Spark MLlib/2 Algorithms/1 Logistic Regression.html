The main items to be careful about are (a) which optimization algorithm is being run and (b) whether feature scaling is being used.\n\n*Feature scaling* refers to normalizing features (columns) to have unit variance.  After training, the model weights are rescaled so that test data does not have to be normalized.  This improves optimization (and often statistical) behavior, but it changes the effect of regularization since the same regularization parameter is used for all weights.\n\nAPIs\n* In `pyspark.mllib.classification` (original MLlib package with lower-level API)\n  * `LogisticRegressionWithSGD`\n    * Does not use feature scaling\n    * Since this does not use feature scaling, it is often important to tune (decrease) the step size to ensure convergence.  If you decrease the step size, you may also need to increase the number of iterations.\n  * `LogisticRegressionWithLBFGS` (*recommended* \\*)\n    * Uses feature scaling\n* In `pyspark.ml.classification` (newer MLlib package with higher-level API for Pipelines)\n  * `LogisticRegression`: Wrapper for `pyspark.mllib.classification.LogisticRegressionWithLBFGS`\n    * Currently, this experimental branch does not support all options, such as fitting the intercept term.\n\n(\\*) *We recommend using `LogisticRegressionWithLBFGS` since the LBFGS optimizer requires less tuning than SGD.  However, if you do not want feature scaling (e.g., you wish to match R results exactly), then we recommend using `LogisticRegressionWithSGD`.*","commandVersion":1,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"startTime":0.0,"submitTime":1.435806446012E12,"finishTime":0.0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":null,"diffDeletes":null,"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"dbadmin","iPythonMetadata":null,"nuid":"b0328baf-d75f-4d70-ae22-01766abba2da"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":2655,"guid":"84800df9-5c68-49df-bd94-252cf216ec59","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":3.0,"command":"%md ## Load data\n\nYou can load data from many sources in Spark.
